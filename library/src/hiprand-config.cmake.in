# hiprand-config.cmake
# ---------
#
# Finds hipRAND include directory and library.
#
# Use this module by invoking find_package with the form:
#
#   find_package(hiprand
#     [version] [EXACT]           # Minimum or EXACT version e.g. 0.5.0
#     [REQUIRED]                  # Fail with error if hipRAND is not found
#     CONFIG                      # Enable Config mode (might be required)
#     [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ]]  # Path to install dir (e.g. /opt/rocm/hiprand)
#   )                        #
#
# The following variables are defined when hipRAND is found:
#
#   hiprand_FOUND            - True if hipRAND headers and library were found
#   hiprand_INCLUDE_DIRS     - hipRAND include directory
#   hiprand_LIBRARY_DIRS     - Link directory for hipRAND library
#   hiprand_LIBRARIES        - hipRAND library to be linked
#   hiprand_VERSION          - HIPRAND_VERSION value from hiprand.h
#
# Example (requires HIP, and rocRAND or cuRAND):
#
#    // Remember to first find and include HIP
#    // See https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP
#    find_package(hiprand REQUIRED CONFIG PATHS "/opt/rocm/hiprand")
#    if(HIP_PLATFORM STREQUAL "hcc")
#      find_package(rocrand REQUIRED CONFIG PATHS "/opt/rocm/rocrand")
#    endif()
#
#    add_executable(foo foo.cpp)
#    // Set HIP flags, includes (see hipconfig)
#    if(HIP_PLATFORM STREQUAL "hcc")
#      // Link foo against HIP library
#      target_link_libraries(foo roc::rocrand hip::hiprand)
#    else()
#      // Link foo against CUDA library
#      target_link_libraries(foo "-lcurand" hip::hiprand)
#    endif()
